# WAX Powerup

This repo contains some functions and front end code for creating a UI that allows WAX users to Power Up their account.

This is not a complete front end, so some of the referenced components are not actually in this repo.

The code here is meant to provide you with the helper functions that are needed in order to estimate/calculate the current powerup costs, and give you some sample UI code of an implementation.
